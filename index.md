## About Me 
I am currently a 3rd year B.S. Computer Science student at University of California San Diego. Currently, I am seeking an internship for the **summer / fall of 2021** in order to gain real-world software developing experience as well as being able to contribute to a company. I believe thet most valuable traits I possess as a coder are: 
1. work ethic
2. good teammate
3. desire to learn
     
By the words of the late Kobe Bryant, 
> A challenge is an opportunity to learn.

In a way, I am constantly `git push`ing myself to be the best that I can be. Outside of school and work, my hobbies include:
- trading stocks
- playing basketball
- playing guitar
  
Some things that I would like to learn include:
- [] Entrepreneurship
- [] writing SQL queries
